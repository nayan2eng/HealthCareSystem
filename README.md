In this projent, we are trying to develop a health care management system 
named Health Care Clinic. This type of project is widely used in many 
organization such as diagonostic center, madecal pharmacy and hospitals

people. It includes three modules named doctor, patient and appointment 
module.

The modules must be filled by the admin. By doctor module, doctor
adding with ID, name, a list of speciality, phone and address information
should be added to the database. All data input by this module should be
displayed by view doctor list event.

Patient module deals with entering patients data with ID, name, gender,
age, address, phone, height & weight. All submitted data will be shown 
by Patient List tab.

The Appointment module deals with setting apponitment with doctor for
specific patients managed by admin. An appointment ID, date, time and
details must be filled. All appointments data should be shown in 
appointment list tab.
